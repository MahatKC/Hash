# Hash

Project developed by  [@MahatKC](https://www.github.com/MahatKC), [@AmandaIsrael](https://www.github.com/AmandaIsrael) and [@igorFNegrizoli](https://www.github.com/igorFNegrizoli) in pair programming in 2022.

This project was an assignment for the Algorithm Analysis and Design course we took in our 4th year of Computer Science.

Coded entirely in Python, it compares the computational cost (regarding time and number of comparisons needed) of different Hash table implementations based on a set of entries provided by the course's professor.

A CSV was created with the results, which was used to build graphs to better analyse and comapre the different implementations.
